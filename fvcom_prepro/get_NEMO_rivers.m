% Extract river data from the supplied river positions for the FVCOM

%
% get_NEMO_rivers(Mobj, dist_thresh)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   For the positions in Mobj.rivers.positions, find the nearest
%   unstructured grid node and extract the river discharge from
%   Mobj.rivers.river_flux. To correct the flux values from the
%   NEMO data, we need the grid size data (in
%   Mobj.rivers.river_coordinates). The river positions must fall
%   within the specified distance (dist_thresh).
%
% INPUT:
%   Mobj - MATLAB mesh object containing:
%       * have_lonlat - boolean to check for spherical coordinates.
%       * lon, lat - positions for the unstructured grid.
%       * tri - triangulation table for the unstructured grid.
%       * nVerts - number of nodes in the grid.
%       * read_obc_nodes - open boundary node IDs.
%       * rivers - river data struct with the following fields:
%           - positions - river positions in lon, lat.
%           - names - list of river names
%           - river_flux - path to the NEMO netCDF data file. Must contain
%           the area of each grid element for conversion of the fluxes.
%   dist_thresh - maximum distance away from a river node beyond
%       which the search for an FVCOM node is abandoned. Units in degrees.
%   The following keyword-argument pairs are also valid:
%   'model_year' - [optional] when giving climatology, a year must be
%       specified so that the time series can be anchored in time. The
%       returned time series will be 3 years long centred on the specified
%       year. Discharges will be repeated for the two additional years.
%   'dump_positions' - [optional] dump the NEMO river positions to the
%       specified text file.
%   'alternate_positions' - [optional] read in a CSV file with alternate
%       positions for the NEMO rivers. Supply a comma separated file with
%       the new values and then the old values as (xnew,ynew,xold,yold).
%       This is useful if you've manually moved the NEMO rivers onto more
%       realistic locations.
%   'remove_baltic' - [optional] remove the Baltic river inputs. Set to
%       true to remove; defaults to false.
%
% OUTPUT:
%   Mobj.river_flux - volume flux at the nodes within the model domain.
%   Mobj.river_nh4 - ammonia
%   Mobj.river_no3 - notrate
%   Mobj.river_o - oxygen
%   Mobj.river_p - phosphate
%   Mobj.river_sio3 - silicate
%   Mobj.river_dic - dissolved inorganic carbon
%   Mobj.river_totalk - total alkalinity
%   Mobj.river_bioalk - bio-alkalinity
%   Mobj.river_nodes - node IDs for the rivers.
%   Mobj.river_names - river names which fall within the model domain. For
%       rivers where the discharge has been summed, the name is compoud,
%       with each contributing name separated by a hyphen (-).
%   Mobj.river_time - Modified Julian Day time series for the river
%       discharge data.
%   Mobj.river_nemo_location - river locations (NEMO positions).
%
% EXAMPLE USAGE:
%   Mobj = get_NEMO_rivers(Mobj, 0.15)
%
%   To extract the NEMO river locations to file:
%
%   Mobj = get_NEMO_rivers(Mobj, 0.15, 'dump_positions', '/tmp/nemo.txt');
%
% Author(s):
%   Pierre Cazenave (Plymouth Marine Laboratory)
%
% Revision history:
%   2016-03-02 - First version based on get_nemo_rivers.m.
%   2016-05-03 - Add option to dump NEMO river locations to text file.
%   2016-06-06 - Remove temperature and salinity from the description as
%   they're really the Baltic Sea inputs only. Also read in the grid area
%   from the new format ERSEM file (variable dA). Add total alkalinity
%   to the outputs.
%   2016-08-10 - Add new option to use a file specifying alternative river
%   positions.
%   2017-10-04 - Add new option to remove the Baltic Sea inputs from the
%   river data.
